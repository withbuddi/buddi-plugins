    'Simulate the balance day by day over the coming weeks from the recorded balances, the active recurring items AND the owner\'s typical variable spending, and report the end balance, the minimum balance and the date it happens, and whether it drops below the safety floor. By default the projection includes a daily burn measured from the last 3 complete months of transactions — the MEDIAN monthly total, so one freak month cannot set it, and with credit-card/loan payments left out as debt servicing (see the `baseline` field of the response for what it is and how it was measured, and `baselineOptions` to change it); pass includeBaseline: false to project the recurring items alone. Person-to-person transfers are excluded unless includeP2P is \'net\'. Pending transactions dated inside the horizon are applied too — a pending charge is money already committed — and listed under `pendingEvents`; pass includePending: false to leave them out. Add `hypotheticals` to test a purchase before making it. Accounts that are not spendable (retirement, investment, HSA) are left out of the start balance entirely and listed under `startBalanceExcludes`, along with any recurring item attached to one. Charges billed to a credit card are left out too — they move no cash on their date; the cash moves when the card is paid, and that payment is already a recurring item here. Use finance.statement_forecast for what a card will report, and finance.card_activity for what it has been doing. The response names `oldestBalanceAsOf` — the as-of date of the oldest recorded balance it started from, with `startBalanceAgeDays` and `startBalanceStale` — and every answer built on this should say that date when the balance is not from today: a projection is only as current as the balance under it.
