Credit-card and loan payments are excluded as debt servicing (see `excluded.byCategory`) because they settle spending already counted and are modelled by the liabilities and recurring items. Person-to-person rails (Zelle, PayPal, Ria, Lemfi, Moneygram) are reported separately under `p2p` because they can be either spending or money being moved around; never fold them into spending without asking. finance.project_cashflow already applies this daily burn, so use this tool to explain *what* the burn is made of, not to add it on top. Accounts that are not spendable (retirement, investment, HSA) are invisible to this measurement: neither their transactions nor their presence in the coverage roll call count.
