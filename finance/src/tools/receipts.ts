/**
 * Receipts — what was bought, as opposed to what the bank charged.
 *
 * A receipt is its own record, not an annotation on a transaction: it can
 * arrive before the charge posts, it can describe a charge that never appears,
 * and it carries line items the bank will never know about. It is linked to a
 * transaction when one matches, and stays unlinked otherwise rather than being
 * forced onto the nearest plausible row.
