/**
 * Card ledgers: what a credit card will report at close, and what it did last
 * month. Pure — no DB, no clock, no timezone; every date arrives as a
 * `YYYY-MM-DD` string already rendered in the owner's zone.
 *
 * A card is a ledger in its own right. Charges live on it (negative: money
 * spent, which raises what is owed), payments and credits live on it too
 * (positive: what is owed goes down), and none of it is cash moving — the cash
 * moves once, later, when the card is paid. That single fact is why card
 * spending is kept out of the cash-flow projection and out of the spending
 * baseline by default: the payment is already modelled, and counting the
 * purchases as well would spend the same money twice.
 *
 * What the card ledger DOES give, and cash never could, is the question the
 * owner actually asks — "when does the GEICO premium hit, and what will the
 * statement say?" — which is `statementForecast` below.
