/**
 * Spending baseline — the variable, unmodelled spend the projection used to
 * ignore. Pure: no DB, no clock, no timezone (the caller passes `today`).
 *
 * The projection knows the recurring items (rent, salary, loan payments). It
 * knew nothing about groceries, Uber, restaurants — the drip that actually
 * empties a checking account. `computeBaseline` measures that drip over whole
 * calendar months and turns it into a daily burn the projection can apply.
 *
 * Three things are deliberately kept OUT of the burn:
 *  - charges that are already a recurring item (they would be counted twice),
 *  - internal transfers between the owner's own accounts (money that never left),
 *  - person-to-person transfers (Zelle/PayPal/Ria/Lemfi/Moneygram), which are
 *    reported separately because they can be spending *or* income shuffling and
 *    only the owner knows which,
 *  - debt servicing (credit-card and loan payments), which is modelled by the
 *    liabilities and recurring items rather than by the everyday-spend burn.
 *
 * The headline number is a **median** across the monthly totals, not a mean.
 * Real ledgers contain one-off months — a debt consolidation, a deposit, a
 * move — and a three-month mean lets a single such month set the burn for the
 * next sixty days. The median ignores it. `meanMonthlyVariableOut` is always
 * reported alongside so the gap between the two is visible.
